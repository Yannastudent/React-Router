      <h2>As a designer, I seek to bring all my skills to bear on creative challenges.
         I love to follow new trends and, at the same time, combine them with classical design principles.
         I try to mix the joy of the creative process with communication to reach people.
         I am team player, but I also enjoy when Iâ€™m able to focus on my own ideas.
         And when people around me admire the result, it motivates me even more as the most important thing in life is to really love what you do.</h2>
